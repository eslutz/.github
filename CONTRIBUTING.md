If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, the following is recommend:

- Open an issue.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

### Reporting bugs

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more information.  Therefore, please investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in the report.  Please complete the following steps in advance to help speed up any potential fix.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). 

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before submitting a bug report

* **Determine which repository the problem should be reported in**.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aeslutz)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How do I submit a (good) bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/paste snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots or videos** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context by answering these questions:

* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Conductor) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently.**
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version are you using?** 
* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using?**

Once the report is submitted:

- The issue will be attempted to reproduce with the provided steps.  If there are no reproduction steps a comment will be left asking for details.  Bugs  will not be addressed until there are steps to reproduce the issue.
- If the issue is not able to be reproduced, or no steps are provided after leaving a comment, the issue will be closed.

### Suggesting enhancements

This section provides guidance for submitting an enhancement suggestion **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**.

#### Before submitting an enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Search for an existing [issue](hhttps://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+user%3Aeslutz) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.  If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How do I submit a (good) enhancement suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.  At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
